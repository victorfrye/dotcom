                Hi! Thank you for taking an interest in me and my website. I'm a full-stack developer from Grand Rapids, Michigan.
                With @GetYearsOfExperience() years of professional experience, I've worked with a variety of
                technologies and platforms. However, I am only just getting started.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently working as a Solutions Developer at <a href="https://leadingedje.com/">Leading EDJE</a>, a
                software consultancy based in Columbus, Ohio.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my downtime, I enjoy gaming, reading, and quality time with my fianc√©e and our two dogs.
            </p>
