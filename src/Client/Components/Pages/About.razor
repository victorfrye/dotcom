                    Hi! Thank you for taking an interest in me and my website. I'm a full-stack developer from Grand Rapids, Michigan.
                    With @GetYearsOfExperience() years of professional experience, I've worked with a variety of
                    technologies and platforms. However, I am only just getting started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working as a Solutions Developer at <a href="https://leadingedje.com/">Leading EDJE</a>, a
                    software consultancy based in Columbus, Ohio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my downtime, I enjoy gaming, reading, and quality time with my fianc√©e and our two dogs.
                </p>
