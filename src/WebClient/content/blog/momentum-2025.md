Thank you to the greater Cincinnati developer community for hosting another Momentum! I was thrilled to return as a consecutive speaker for my second year and capstone my first year speaking at local conferences with the one that started it all for me. I saw so many familiar faces and met many new friends as well. The Cincinnati community continues to impress me and I look forward to potentially visiting again in the future. Cheers!

Two exciting callouts from the event: we had some amazing representation from my employer, [Leading EDJE](https://leadingedje.com), with several team members speaking and attending including [Bob Fornal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfornal/) and [Ed LeGault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-legault-37aba4) who spoke on automated testing and DORA/EBM respectively. Additionally, my local Grand Rapids community showed up with fellow speakers and friends [Brian McKeiver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmckeiver) and [Jonathan "J." Tower](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtower) who presented on developer estimates and over-engineering. It was great to see this cross-pollination of communities in Cincinnati!

This blog post is a reference for those who attended my presentation as well as a thank you letter to everyone involved.

## Cloud Terraformation

My presentation was titled "Cloud Terraformation" and focused on infrastructure as code using Terraform to manage Azure resources. The session covered the ClickOps problem, an overview of Terraform as a choice for infrastructure as code, and a live demo of setting up Terraform with Azure, exporting existing resources, and managing them through code. Unfortunately, we had some technical difficulties with the live demo so no one got to see the final result, but it did work! Thank you for bearing with me through that AV hiccup.
